Predicting House Prices with Linear Regression

In this project, my aim was to develop a predictive model for house prices using linear regression technique. I leveraged various features such as Lot Area(square footage), number of bedrooms, number of bathrooms, overall condition etcetra given in the dataset to estimate the Sale price of the houses. The 'train' dataset contained historical information about houses including varied attributes along with their corresponding prices. By training the linear regression model on the 'train' dataset, I learnt about the relationship between the features and the target variable (Sale price), allowing me to make accurate predictions for new houses given in the 'test' dataset. Through this project, I explored the predictive power of linear regression in the realm of real estate and understood how various features contribute to determining house prices.
